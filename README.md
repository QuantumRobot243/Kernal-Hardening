# KR-SEE: Kernel-Level Security & Memory Enforcement

**KR-SEE** is a kernel-level security framework and hardening toolkit focused on **memory persistence control, anti-debugging, entropy management, and isolation**. It is designed for researchers, security engineers, and developers who want to explore or implement strong runtime security guarantees.

This README combines **conceptual explanation, mathematical formalism, and implementation insight**. KR-SEE is not just code—it is the expression of security principles in action.

## Motivation

Modern systems often **fail to protect secrets in memory**, especially against low-level attacks such as:

* Cold-boot attacks
* ptrace / debugging attacks
* Swap / pagefile analysis
* Exploit-triggered panics

KR-SEE attempts to **formalize and enforce memory-bound secrets**, system isolation, and runtime hardening.

## Core Principles

### 1. Memory Persistence

Secrets must reside **only in RAM** and die immediately on power loss. This prevents forensic retrieval from SSDs or swap.

Let:

* K = secret data
* R = RAM
* D = Disk/Swap

Then:

```
K ∈ R  ∧  K ∉ D
```

We enforce a **time-to-live** tied to the RAM power cycle:

```
TTL(K) = TTL(R) < ∞
```

In practice:

* Use `mlock()` to pin memory
* Avoid any swapping
* Ensure secrets vanish on power-off

This gives **true ephemeral secrets**.

---

### 2. Anti-Debugging

We attempt to prevent attackers from observing processes via ptrace.

Let:

* P = process
* Obs(P) = set of observers of P

Lock invariant:

```
Obs(P) = { P }
```

Failure invariant:

```
Obs(P) = ∅ ⇒ ∃ Attacker : Attacker → P
```

> In plain language: You cannot build a perfect fortress in Linux without OS support. KR-SEE recognizes these limits.

### 3. Entropy Decay

Secrets are high-entropy data. On deletion, **entropy must vanish**.

Let:

* H(K) = entropy of secret K
* t_end = end of lifecycle

Then:

```
lim t→t_end H(K_t) = 0
```

Implementation:

* Maintain a global registry of secret pointers
* Force overwrite (`zeroize`) for all bits
* Memory physically scrubbed before release

```rust
for bit in K {
    bit := 0
}
```

This ensures no residual data remains after destruction.

---

### 4. Failure Semantics

Panic or crashes are **not accidents—they are attack vectors**.

Let:

* C = cleanup function
* F = failure event

If:

```
panic = "abort" ⇒ F ⇒ Immediate Exit
```

Then:

```
C ∉ δ(F)  ⇒  ∃ F : H(K) > 0 at termination
```

> KR-SEE documents these failure semantics transparently. Users must account for panics as potential leaks.

---

### 5. Kernel-Level Isolation

KR-SEE assumes **host environment cannot be trusted**.

#### Namespaces

* `unshare` User & Mount namespaces
* Map current user to virtual root
* Run unprivileged on host

#### Seccomp

* Strict syscall filter in **Trap mode**
* Only ~50 whitelisted syscalls allowed

Formally:

* S = set of all Linux syscalls
* A = allowed syscalls

```
A ⊂ S,  |A| ≈ 50
```

```
∀ s ∈ S : s ∉ A ⇒ Kernel Trap
```

This drastically reduces **attack surface**.

---

## Threat Model

KR-SEE defends against:

* Memory dumping / cold-boot attacks
* Debugging & ptrace attacks
* Unauthorized syscall execution
* Standard crash / panic attacks

KR-SEE **does not guarantee immunity** from kernel exploits or hardware-level attacks.

---

## Architecture

KR-SEE consists of:

1. **Memory Management Layer** – pins, zeroizes, and tracks secrets
2. **Anti-Debugging Layer** – enforces self-tracing invariants
3. **Isolation Layer** – namespaces and seccomp filters
4. **Runtime Hardening Layer** – panic hooks, thread-safe pointers, secure shutdown

All layers are **modular and mathematically reasoned**.

* Secrets are pinned to RAM
* Syscall enforcement active
* Anti-debugging hooks loaded
